      <section class="bio">
        I am a Junior at Boston College studying Computer Science and Economics
        wiht a minor in Finance. I've worked as a teacher's assistant for
        Computer Science 1 for three semesters and I am on the E-Board for
        Computer Science Society as the Career and Community Leader and the
        Co-President of the Student Martial Arts Club. I'm interested in a
        career in software engineering or machine learning which I'm currently
        exploring through a supervised learning machine learning project with
        MathWorks to predict motor control performance. Additionally, I am
        helping a financial literacy public benefit corporation localize its
        platform in order to support Spanish translations for non-native English
        speakers.
