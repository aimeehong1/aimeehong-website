    "bio": "Hi, I’m <strong>Aimee Hong</strong>! I’m a Computer Science and Economics student, with a minor in Finance and an expected graduation of May 2026. From taking courses in web application and iOS app development, to corporate finance, financial accounting, and game theory in economics, I've explored a wide range of topics that interest me. Currently, I’m honing my skills in software development, machine learning, and web development, with experience in Python, Java, C, Swift, JavaScript and more. <br /><br /> Beyond the classroom, I’ve worked as a Software Engineer Intern, where I localized a financial literacy platform to support Spanish translations, ultimately with the goal of making financial literacy more accessible to non-native English speakers. I’m also a teaching assistant for an introductory computer scinece course based in Python and will soon transition to being a teaching assistant for a Swift iOS app development undergraduate course. <br /><br /> Additionally, I'm a current participant in the <a href='https://www.breakthroughtech.org/'>Break Through Tech</a> AI program at MIT, where I am part of a network that envisions women fairly represented in every room where technical decisions are made. I have benefited from engaging in real-world machine-learning industry projects and receiving mentorship from technical professionals. My projects span from building full-stack mobile apps to creating machine learning models. I love tackling new challenges, especially those that make a positive impact, and I have a passion for building meaningful technology."
